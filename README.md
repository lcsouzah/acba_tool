## Android release signing

Release builds require a signing key that is not checked in to version
control.  Place your keystore file under `android/app/keystore/` and provide
the following properties either as environment variables or in a nonâ€‘versioned
Gradle properties file (for example, in `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`):

```
KEYSTORE_PATH=/absolute/path/to/keystore.jks
KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=your_store_password
KEY_ALIAS=your_key_alias
KEY_PASSWORD=your_key_password
```

These values are loaded by `android/app/build.gradle.kts` when creating the
release signing configuration.  Keep any property files with these secrets
out of version control.
